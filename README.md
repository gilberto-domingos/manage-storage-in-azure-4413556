# Manage Storage in Azure
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Manage Storage in Azure. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

A strong understanding of cloud storage is vital not only for successfully managing data, but also for optimizing cloud spend. In this course, instructor Nicole Stevens covers important aspects of storage in Azure, including code-related deployments, deploying environments with storage accounts via code and Azure Bicep, along with how to authorize access through SDKs for developers. This demo-focused course provides instruction for managing Azure storage with PowerShell and the Azure CLI as well as in the Azure portal.

## Instructions
This repository does not have any branches. Clone the entire repository and you get the demo environments and other setups to look at, all in their final state.

Each top level folder corresponds to a chapter, then a folder underneath to a video or videos with files specific to that video. Resources may be required for multiple videos, therefore please use the following table to map a folder to a video title.

Within each folder is a chapter-X-readme.md file, this contains the commands to be run in the cloudshell to create each environment. The environments allow you to follow along with the videos.

## Installing

The bicep files are designed to be run in Azure Cloudshell. You do not require anything installed locally to use the bicep files. However, if you would like to study the files locally I recommend the following:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Add the following extensions to VSCode:

    * [Bicep](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)

    * [Azure tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/extensions)

    * [Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

    * [Azure CLI Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli)

    * [PowerShell in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/powershell)

    * [Avro Data Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RandomFractalsInc.vscode-data-preview)

To use the bicep, python and script files in Azure Cloudshell, clone the repository within the cloudshell, CD to the appropriate directory for your video and execute the commands from the chapter-X-readme.md file at the cloudshell command line. For help with Cloudshell, checkout the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart)

There are also further tools shown in the demos, to use these tools you can install from the following links:

3. Get started with [azcopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10)

4. [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/storage/storage-explorer)

5. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) for Windows
